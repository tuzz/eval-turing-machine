## Chapter 4

**Ruby**

A Ruby implementation of the small-step method definitions from the chapter.

I tried to keep the code as true to the chapter as possible, even though the
resulting code isn't nice.

**Turing Machine**

I also had a go at implementing the eval function as a plain Turing Machine. The
rules are quite hard to read and it took me several hours to figure out.

You can see it running
[here](http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html?5c8597ba8908a4e42c22c320ad2e7c9e).
There are some other examples listed in the comments to try.
